# health-checks
Scripts that check the health of my computers

This repo will be populated with lots of fancy checks!


health_checks.py contain functions that check the system for errors.

After running checks "Everything is Ok" will be printed if no errors,
otherwise corresponding error message will be displayed.

Return code: 1 if errors are found and 0 if none.
